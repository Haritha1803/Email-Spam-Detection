# Email Spam Detection

## Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to detect spam emails. It uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to classify emails as spam or not spam. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Flask application for deploying the spam detection model.
- `spam.csv`: Dataset used for training the model.
- `spam_detection_model.h5`: Pre-trained model file.
- `LSTM_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the model training code.
- `a.html`: HTML template used by the Flask application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Haritha1803/Email-Spam-Detection.git
